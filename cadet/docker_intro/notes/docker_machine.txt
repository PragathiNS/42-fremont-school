Use Docker machine to:
1. Install and run Docker on Mac or Windows.
2. Provision and manage multiple remote Docker hosts
3. Provision Swarm Clusters

DM?
It is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage
the hosts with docker-machine commands.

Start, inspect, stop and restart a managed host, upgrade the Docker client and
Daemon and configure a Docker client to talk to your host.

Difference between Docker Engine and Docker Machine?
Docker / Docker Engine --> Client-server application made up of the Docker
daemon, a REST API that specifies interfaces for interacting with the daemon,
and a Command Line Interface (CLI) client that talks to the daemon (throught the
REST API wrapper).

Docker Machine --> a tool for provisioning and managing our Dockerized hosts
(hosts with Docker engine on them). Typically, DM is installed on the local
system. It has its own command line client docker-machine and the Docker engine
client docker.
machine can be used to install Docker Engine on one or more virtual systems.
These can be local or remote. Local - When you use Machine to install and run
Docker Engine in VirtualBox on Mac or Windows.
Remote - When you use Machine to provision Dockerized hosts on cloud providers.

Use Machine to run Docker Containers,
1. create a new (or start an existing) Docker virtual Machine
2. switch your env to your new VM
3. use the docker client to create, load and manage containers

docker-machine create -d virtualbox default
This command downloads a lightweight Linux distribution (boot2docker) with the Docker daemon installed, and creates and starts a VirtualBox VM with Docker running.
