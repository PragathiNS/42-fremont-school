Symlinks --> Symbolic links (are special files that point to files or
directories in other locations on your system)

Particularly useful when apps don't want to work correctly with a regular alias.

"ln" utility (creates symbolic links in macOS)

Symlinks works in every application on the system, including command-line
utilities in the terminal. The link that you create appears to apps to be the
same as the original file or folder it's pointing at-even though it's just a
link.

Hard links --> A symbolic or soft link points to a path in the file system. 
It will actually point to the underlying INODE on the file system.
If you created a hard link from /users/ex pointing to opt/ex and later moved
/opt/ex, the link at /users/ex would still point to the file, no matter where
you moved it. The hard link works at the lower level.
